# Spruce Therapy site

This is the website for sprucetherapy.ca, hosted by GitHub pages and built with Jekyll.

## Developing

1. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/) (on Windows it's easiest to use WSL and install Jekyll on [Ubuntu](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/ubuntu/))
2. `bundle exec jekyll serve` to build the static files and watch them for changes

## Deploying

Create a PR and merge to `main`. GitHub pages takes care of the rest.

## Notes

- Got bootstrap integrated with help from this article: https://freddyheppell.com/blog/using-bootstrap-4-with-jekyll
