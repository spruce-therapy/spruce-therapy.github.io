  I feel pretty lucky that my work involves coming alongside folks as they take steps in a
  new direction, courageously look at their past to help them understand their present,
  and work through challenges that sometimes feel insurmountable. Watching clients reconnect
  to their resiliency and strength to make positive changes in their lives gives me goosebumps
  every time!

  I came to my therapy career in a long and roundabout way that includes an unfinished degree
  in architecture, and a handful of jobs in the helping field. I have degrees in Psychology
  (B.A., University of Manitoba) and Counselling Psychology (M.C., University of Lethbridge)
  and am registered as a Canadian Certified Counsellor through the Canadian Counselling and
  Psychotherapy Association.

  I’ve spent much of my career as a therapist working with adults working through the
  long-lasting impacts of childhood trauma. As a result, I’ve worked with clients with
  many different issues, from anxiety, depression, and substance use, to trouble regulating
  emotions, difficult relationships and anger. My work has led me to believe that our hurts
  usually happen in relationships and so that’s usually where our healing occurs too – in
  finding connection with others and ourselves.
