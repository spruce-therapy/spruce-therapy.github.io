  I help my clients address the unresolved symptoms of relational trauma. These symptoms might include feeling mistrustful or on edge around others, anger that feels out of control, feelings of anxiety and shame, or finding oneself triggered all. the. time. The symptoms vary, but the fallout is usually the same: disconnection from self and from others. This disconnection can impact one’s outlook on life, contribute to poor decision making, trigger physical pain, and negatively impact interpersonal relationships.

  I know that what you’ve just read might feel overwhelming and hopeless, but my experience with clients has shown me the resilience of the human spirit. My work is grounded in the belief that healing and wholeness are possible in an environment of compassion and connection, and with someone who truly sees you and gets you.
</p>
<p>
  My aim is that our work together can create a sense of safety and hope that empowers you to rediscover your strength and belonging in the world. So, if you’re feeling like parts of who you are keep getting in the way of building healthy relationships with yourself and others it might be time to find some healing because we’re all built for connection.
