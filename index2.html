  I help individuals address the challenges in their lives that keep them feeling stuck.
  The specifics are different for every person I see, but the broad themes of my work often
  include developing a deeper understanding of how the past continues to impact them, helping
  to minimize feelings of shame, working to increase self-worth, assisting them in finding tools
  to better manage strong emotions, and finding a way back toward authenticity. No matter what
  you bring, my goal is always the same: to help you create a life that just feels better.
</p>
<p>
  My work is grounded in the belief that positive change happens most effectively within a
  non-judgmental and compassionate therapeutic relationship. I come alongside you to
  collaboratively determine the unique direction of our work that honours where you're at
  and where you want to go: seeking to understand your struggles and honouring your strengths.
</p>
<p>
  When the things that used to help you cope aren't working anymore, or you feel like you need
  to start asking new questions or making different decisions, counselling might be the next
  right step. My aim is that our work together can create a sense of safety and hope that empowers
  you to rediscover your strength, resilience and belonging in the world.
